# Guess The Food Game

<div class="media-container">

This game is a food guessing game. The foods are Indonesian food.

I have made some of the styles using the Bootstrap library, and used a CSS background website for the background of the page. Of course, I used HTML for the main page

I used JavaScript for changing the site's content as the user interacts with it.

Once the user presses the start button, the JavaScript code then selects a random word form a list of available words.

Then, the code scrambles the word, and displays it to the user.

If the answer was incorrect, the user is asked to try again, if it is correct, a message will appear, stating it is correct. From there, the user can go back to the game and try another word.
